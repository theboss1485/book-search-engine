# Book Search Engine

## Description

My motivation for building this project was to gain experience with using GraphQL and Apollo Server.  I wanted to gain experience with writing and using type defs, resolvers, queries and mutations.  I built this project because I believed that GraphQL would be a worthwhile skill to learn and would help market me to future employers.  This project solves the problem of a user wanting to search for books and then save their favorite books so that he or she can come back and view them later.  For this project, I took starter code and modified it to use GraphQL.  In the process, I learned how to use GraphQL and Apollo Server.  I learned how to defined type defs, resolvers, queries, and mutations, and I also leanred how to troubleshoot the application when it doesn't work as expected.
