# Book Search Engine

## Description

My motivation for building this project was to gain experience with using GraphQL and Apollo Server.  I wanted to gain experience with writing and using type defs, resolvers, queries and mutations.  I built this project because I believed that GraphQL would be a worthwhile skill to learn and would help market me to future employers.  This project solves the problem of users wanting to search for books and then save their favorite books so that they can come back and view those books later.  For this project, I took a project with a RESTful API and modified it to use GraphQL.  In the process, I learned how to use GraphQL and Apollo Server.  I learned how to defined type defs, resolvers, queries, and mutations, and I also leanred how to troubleshoot the application when it didn't work as expected.
